        Callers driving the text or touch device pass it via ``require_attrs``
        (e.g. ``("_text_device",)``): a paused text/touch device would
        otherwise accept the readiness short-circuit on pointer + keyboard
        alone and the injection would be silently dropped. Slot handles are
        resolved fresh on every poll, so a reconnect inside the wait is
        observed immediately.

        This check is best-effort: KWin may pause or remove its devices
        between the readiness check and the actual event injection, and such
        an injection is silently dropped by libei. Batching key strokes into
        a single frame (``keyboard_burst``) minimises that window; the next
        injection's dispatch/drain path recovers (adopted from 01SW/kwin-mcp).

        KWin can remove/re-add or pause its EIS devices around input bursts
        (observed right after session start and after modifier presses).
        Re-advertised devices are re-registered while draining the event
        queue. If the wait fails — devices stalled (paused without resume),
        or the connection was marked dead by a DISCONNECT event or a failed
        ``ei_dispatch`` — the whole connection is rebuilt. A successful
        reconnect guarantees emulating devices, because ``_setup`` runs the
        device negotiation itself and raises on failure.

        Wingman #235: KWin may pause its devices right after EVERY fresh
        handshake (the pause cycle — the fresh connection lives under a
        second, then the cycle repeats), so a single reconnect + re-check
        (issue #228 shape) loses against the cycle. The reconnect is
        therefore retried a bounded number of times (``_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS``),
        each attempt getting one ``_POST_RECONNECT_READY_TIMEOUT_S`` re-check
        window; exhausting the budget tears the connection down and fails
        loudly with the attempt count. The loop additionally stops starting
        new attempts on the ``_RECONNECT_RETRY_BUDGET_S`` reconnect-attempt
        wall budget (issue #16, F7; issue #18, R2 — checked between
        attempts, not a call-wide deadline: an in-flight handshake may run
        past it): the attempt count alone does not bound one call, and the
        ToolError names the attempts actually made. A
        reconnect that raises inside ``_setup`` (D-Bus/libei/handshake
        error) still aborts immediately: the state is already clean (#229)
        and retrying a hard failure only adds latency. The pre-reconnect
        stall wait was shortened to ``_STALL_READY_TIMEOUT_S`` accordingly.

        After each successful reconnect the requested ``require_attrs`` slots
        are re-checked against the FRESH connection (bounded re-wait, issue
        #228): the fresh handshake only guarantees pointer + keyboard, so a
        text / touch slot may come back paused or unadvertised — such an
        attempt counts as failed and the loop continues. A clean ToolError
        stops the injection after the budget — a silent drop into a paused
        or NULL device is exactly what this gate exists to prevent.
        (A failed reconnect raises inside ``_reconnect`` and never reaches
        the re-check.)

        Wingman #235 attempt 2: when the budget is exhausted, the held
        key/button sets (issue #233) are cleared if non-empty and the
        ToolError names the reset. Per the libei API every PAUSED reset the
        logical state to neutral, so after a lost battle against the pause
        cycle the server holds nothing logically down — the client sets are
        guaranteed stale, and replaying them on the next fresh handshake
        would restart the cycle (a replayed modifier press pauses this KWin
        build again). With the sets cleared, the next call's fresh handshake
        carries no replayed press and the devices stay emulating. The reset
        clause is only added to the message when held state actually
        existed; the plain exhaustion message is unchanged.
